            My name is Lisa Carter. I have been a licensed massage therapist for
            24 years in Oregon. I am a mother of five and have been studying the
            healing arts for most of my life. After a near-death experience in
            2019, I had a profound ongoing awakening in realizing and facing the
            fact that I wasn't living my most authentic life. I started on a
            path searching for my deeper soulful nature. Through ongoing
            self-inquiry, sorrowful and joyful grieving - I found a powerful
            resource in seeking stillness and what I call sacred rest. It's been
            a practice of coming home to myself again and again. And it's from
            this spirit and a desire to share our journeys, experiences, and
            healing that I lovingly offer this sacred time and space together
            through New Dawn Retreats. New Dawn's journey is a path of love.
            Love is the binding force that connects us all, to sacred Mother
            Earth, and to the Divine.
